# A Simple To Do App

But with a Rust backend and HTMX principles

## How to run this app:

1. Clone this repository
2. Start the server

```
cd backend
cargo run
```

Once the server has started, a `Server listening on 127.0.0.1:3000` message should be printed to the terminal.

3. Open `127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser
